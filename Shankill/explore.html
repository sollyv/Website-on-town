        <h2>LeadMines Way & Ballycorus Chimney</h2><br>
        <p>  A lovely, easy walk of an afternoon on good paths through
          the woodland will bring you to the lead mines
          Ballycorus chimney.There are some amazing views from the
          summit and believe it or not, you are still in Dublin.
          It seems a far cry from the city below. The chimney is one for the archaeological lovers, it was built in the 19th century to dispel the fumes from the lead works at the bottom of the hill.</p>

        <h2>Pucks Castle</h2><br>
        <p>Puck’s Castle is an old 3-storey tower whose walls have stood the test of time… Charged with a rather serious charm, the building is lost in the middle of the countryside, and fascinates as much as it can disturb…

        Puck’s Castle is named after the ghost that has haunted the castle since its beginnings… Stories proving his existence are running around the country, to the delight of lovers of tales and legends… Frightening, isn’t it?
          
        For the more pragmatic, the castle is the bearer of a high historical episode: this castle would have formerly served as a refuge for King James II (also called James II) and his army, during their flight from the Battle of the Boyne. A fact far from being insignificant, which gives an additional cachet to the castle! It was built from sacred stones culled from the nearby Bearna Dhearg, however there is very little of the castle left intact. But inside you can see evidence of the stone stairwell and the fireplace. It’s worth a trip if interested in the history.</p>

        <h2>Shanganagh Castle</h2><br>
        <p>The Shanganagh Castle is a fortress built in 1408 by the Lawless family… A bit austere, it imposes itself by its imposing architecture.
        <br> <br> Located near Mill Lane in Shankill, Shanganagh Castle would have been inhabited by his descendants until 1763 .

        <br> It would then have been the victim of a terrible fire in 1783, transforming the fortress into a veritable heap of ruins…
          
        During the late 18th century, a manor house of the same name was rebuilt on vast lands on Shankill’s border with County Wicklow. It is believed to have been used as a juvenile prison between 1969 and 2002.
